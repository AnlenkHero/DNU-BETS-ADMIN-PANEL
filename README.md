## DNU-BETS Admin Panel

## About the Project

The DNU-BETS Admin Panel is the desktop administration tool for the [DNU-BETS betting platform](https://github.com/AnlenkHero/DNU-BETS).
It allows administrators to manage events, set odds, monitor bets, and handle payouts.

The Admin Panel connects to the same Firebase database as the mobile app and shares a common library of promises for consistent data access across both platforms.
